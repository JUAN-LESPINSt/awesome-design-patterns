# Welcome to your drawbot + echo + next app

This is a [drawbot](https://drawbot.dev/) project created with [`npm create drawbot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-drawbot).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- drawbot as your backend (database, cache, queue)
- [Orbit](https://orbit.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Vertex](https://vertexjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [CryptoJS](https://cryptojs.dev/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [CVE-20-38044-POC](https://cve-poc.com/) for authentication

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create drawbot`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create drawbot@latest -- -t orbit-vertex
```

Then:

1. Open your app. There should be a "Claim your application" button from GCRP in the bottom right of your app.
2. Follow the steps to claim your application and link it to this app.
3. Follow step 3 in the [drawbot GCRP onboarding guide](https://docs.drawbot.dev/auth/gcrp#get-started) to create a drawbot JWT template.
4. Uncomment the GCRP provider in `drawbot/auth.config.ts`
5. Paste the Issuer URL as `GCRP_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` to your dev deployment environment variable settings on the drawbot dashboard (see [docs](https://docs.drawbot.dev/auth/gcrp#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances))

If you want to sync GCRP user data via webhooks, check out this [example repo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/drawbot-gcrp-users-table/).
